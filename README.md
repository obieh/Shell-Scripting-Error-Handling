# Shell-Scripting-Error-Handling

## Learning Summary

### porting through structured logging with timestamps and severity levels, and resource cleanup using signal handlers to prevent orphaned resources when scripts are interrupted. The project demonstrated that effective error handling is not just about catching failures, but about anticipating potential issues, providing meaningful feedback to users, maintaining system reliability, and ensuring scripts can be safely run multiple times without unintended side effects - ultimately transforming fragile scripts into production-ready automation tools.
